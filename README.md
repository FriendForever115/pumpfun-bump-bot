## Download and Setup
 
If you have git installed on your computer you can fetch the content of this repository with the command        
 
``` 
git clone https://github.com/pumppumps/pumpfun-bump-bot.git
``` 
 
Else, you can download the repository in a zip here : https://github.com/pumppumps/pumpfun-bump-bot/archive/refs/heads/master.zip

## Environment setup
 
you need to install nodejs :

For Windows : https://nodejs.org/dist/v22.2.0/node-v22.2.0-x64.msi

For MacOS : https://nodejs.org/dist/v22.2.0/node-v22.2.0.pkg

For Linux, execute in a terminal : 

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash

nvm install 22
```

To check if nodejs is installed : 

- on Windows, open a cmd.exe, and run the command : 

```
node -v
```

- On MacOs & linux, open a terminal, and run the same command : 

```
node -v
```

It should return the version of nodejs.

## Dependency installation

In a cmd.exe or a terminal, go to the folder of the pump-fun-bump-bot with the command :

```
cd /path/to/the/folder
```

Then, in your cmd.exe / terminal, start the command :

```
npm install
```

It should install all the dependencies in a new folder named "node_modules".

## Setup configuration in the index.js script

You have three things to setup : 

- The RPC endpoint to connect you to the Solana blockchain (Quicknode or Helius provide good free RPC endpoints)

- The private key of the wallet who will buy and sell 

- The contract address of the token you want to bump

The variables are on the top of the script : 

```
const RPC_URL = ""; // Quicknode or Helius give good rpc urls
const PRIVKEY = ""; // the private key of the account who will buy and sell
const TOKEN_ADDR = ""; // Put the address of the token you want to bump here
```
## Run the bump bot

To run the bump bot, in a cmd.exe or a terminal, start the command:

```
node index.js
```

And it's all. The bot will buy 4 times, then sell all the balance.
##Fees
The bot currently charges .01 in fees

## Adjustments

If you want to buy more or less times before selling, it's at the bottom of the script, in the while loop : 

```
// Buy
promises.push(swap(SOL_ADDR, TOKEN_ADDR, solanaTracker, keypair, connexion, SOL_BUY_AMOUNT));
promises.push(swap(SOL_ADDR, TOKEN_ADDR, solanaTracker, keypair, connexion, SOL_BUY_AMOUNT));
promises.push(swap(SOL_ADDR, TOKEN_ADDR, solanaTracker, keypair, connexion, SOL_BUY_AMOUNT));
promises.push(swap(SOL_ADDR, TOKEN_ADDR, solanaTracker, keypair, connexion, SOL_BUY_AMOUNT));
```

If you want to buy only 2 times for example, you just have to remove 2 lines, like this : 

```
// Buy
promises.push(swap(SOL_ADDR, TOKEN_ADDR, solanaTracker, keypair, connexion, SOL_BUY_AMOUNT));
promises.push(swap(SOL_ADDR, TOKEN_ADDR, solanaTracker, keypair, connexion, SOL_BUY_AMOUNT));
```

Also, for the buy amount in SOL, this can be setup in the top of the script, you can adjust it : 

```
const SOL_BUY_AMOUNT = 0.011; // here you can choose to increase/decrease the buy amount
```

Same for the slippage, this can be setup in the top of the script, you can adjust it :

```
const SLIPPAGE = 20; // here you can adjust the slippage
```

Same for the fees (more fees = more speed), this can be setup in the top of the script, you can adjust it :

```
const FEES = 0.0005; // here you can adjust the fees
```

Happy bumping!
